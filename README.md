About Valorant:

Valorant consists of five man team to complete the mission to detonate or defuse the spike. There are 4 roles to choose from in the beginning of the game: Duelists, Sentinels, Controllers and Initiators. From those four roles, we have all together 18 characters to  select.

Before the rounds start, there are 30 seconds of buying phase for guns and abilities selections. To win, the attackers must either eliminate all opposing players or plant the spike and prevent spike from defusing. On the other hand, the defenders need to eliminate all players before the spike plant or defuse the spike.
